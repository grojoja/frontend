    Cryptographically Secure End-to-End File Sharing
  </div>
  <p><left>The project involves the creation of a secure file sharing system in Go, akin to Dropbox, with a primary focus on cryptographic security. Users can securely register and log in, and their credentials are hashed and stored. 
    Files are encrypted using AES-CTR encryption with unique keys for each file, and users can save, overwrite, and append to files with encryption and decryption built in. Secure file sharing is enabled through encrypted access tokens, and users can revoke access. 
    The server is designed to be tamper-resistant, and key management ensures secure storage and retrieval of encryption keys. Error handling, logging, thorough testing, and user-friendly documentation complete the system, delivering a robust and secure file sharing platform.</left></p>

    3 Stage RISC-V Pipelined CPU
  </div>
  In our FPGA project, we developed a RISC-V pipelined CPU with a three-stage pipeline structure, achieving a clock speed of 111MHz. The pipeline consists of IF/ID, EXEC, and WB stages, each performing specific functions such as instruction fetching, execution, and memory access. Memory hierarchy includes IMEM, DMEM, MMIO, and BIOS, facilitating efficient data access and manipulation. Our CPU architecture incorporates hazard handling mechanisms including pipeline stalls, data forwarding, and control hazard prediction to ensure smooth and accurate execution.

Key submodules such as Instruction Fetch, Execute, and Memory Access are meticulously designed to optimize performance and functionality. Testing and verification procedures involved unit testing, integration testing, and validation on physical hardware, ensuring functional correctness and meeting timing criteria. Furthermore, FOM measurements illustrate the significant improvements achieved through optimization strategies, including pipelining, control logic simplification, and Vivado directives.

Despite challenges such as BIOS initialization and UART communication issues, diligent testing and debugging efforts led to successful resolution and validation of our design. Overall, this project highlights the importance of meticulous planning, thorough testing, and iterative optimization in FPGA development.

    Useful/Useless Reddit Comment Classification
  </div>
  In our Reddit comment classification project, we utilized logistic regression with n-grams, bag of words, and word2vec embeddings to develop a classifier distinguishing helpful from unhelpful comments, leveraging the Reddit API for data collection. Through meticulous preprocessing and feature extraction, including tokenization, stop-word removal, and stemming, we tackled challenges such as data imbalance and model complexity, achieving commendable accuracy and gaining insights into comment dynamics. Python, natural language processing, machine learning, and data analysis skills were instrumental in our approach, with the integration of advanced techniques like word embeddings and comparative analysis further enriching our classifier's performance. Moving forward, we aim to explore deep learning architectures and contextual embeddings to enhance the model's robustness and applicability in fostering constructive online discourse.

      Wordnet
    </div>
    <p> In this project, I created a tool that allows users to explore hyponyms (more specific words) of input words and analyze their relative frequencies over time. I'll need to parse WordNet's dataset, create a graph representing synsets and their relationships, and implement a hyponym lookup mechanism. Users can enter single or multiple words, specify a time frame, and set a limit on the number of hyponyms to retrieve. The project also involves adding new buttons to the NGordnet interface and creating JavaScript handlers to facilitate interactions between the front end and back end.

  <p><left> An ESP32 based device, Outdoor Guardian was designed to be a cost effective and small form factor safety product for outdoor enthusiasts. 
    Utilizing LoRaWAN, users are able to transmit their heart rate data and GPS location (longitude and latitude). 
    When users' heart rates drop or rise too quickly, an emergency signal is cast to the other LoRaWAN device with a message and beep alerting to someone in danger.
    This mode will send the endangered person's location, distance, and direction based on the rescuer's device. In addition to this, users can send and receive audio over a 
    mesh network at the press of a button. Boasting over a 5km range, LoRaWAN is ideal for 
    pairs or groups of people in outdoor settings.

    Face Recognition Security Camera
  </div>
  <p><left>Using ESP32-CAM and TinyML, I developed a security camera that can recognize and identify you based on your face. Models were trained on a 70/30 split with 70 percent of the 
    model training being performed on the laptop and 30 percent on the ESP32 itself. The camera uses an I2S speaker, microphone, and amplifier to allow for communication between myself
    and whoever is outside. The ESP32-CAM connects wireless to any device within my network, and users are able to see a livefeed of whoever approaches the door. Future iterations will
    include the ability to unlock the door based on facial and vocal recognition.

    Grojo's World
  </div>
  <p><left>I've developed a 2D Java game where players explore procedurally generated worlds using seed inputs. Their goal is to collect food for survival and progression while beating a timer that decreases in time each level.
    The game offers save functionality for convenience and includes a safety net that grants players a second chance in a new randomly generated room 
    if they fail, with game over only occurring after the second chance.

    Spam and Ham Classifier
  </div>
  <p><left>In this project, I focused on enhancing the accuracy of a spam email filter system, aiming to achieve a minimum accuracy of 85% on both the training and test datasets. 
    To accomplish this, I conducted thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) and leveraged linear algebra techniques for feature engineering. This involved creating new features based on email content, such as character and word counts, punctuation usage, and HTML text extraction. 
    Additionally, I processed email data to extract meaningful text from HTML content, explored HTML tags as potential features, and fine-tuned logistic regression models using GridSearchCV with cross-validation to prevent overfitting. 
    This project not only improved the spam filter's accuracy but also showcased my proficiency in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection.
